# ofigen-cpp-magnum
# ofigen-cpp C++ implementation of OFIGEN, a Blender plugin for creating training data for neural networks learning optical flow. This version is standalone and optimized for performance to enable creating big datasets in a short-time.  ## Tasks: * Read in backgrounds as image files, which will provide a background for the scene * Read in 3D models as `.obj` files, that will be placed on the scene * Move the objects/camera/lights on the scene randomly * Render the result of one iteration of movement to an image on the GPU * Provide the result in a text file, that will be used by the neural network for learning * Easy configuration using a config file for setting backgrounds, models, random parameters, etc. * Ability to see the rendered pictures real-time on the screen
